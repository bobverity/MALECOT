Description: Carries out joint estimation of complexity of infection (COI) and
    population structure on malaria genetic data. Assumes a simple model in which
    individuals have genotypes sampled from one or more subpopulations, and the number
    of genotypes in an individual is equal to the COI, which is also unknown. All
    unknown parameters are inferred using MCMC.
